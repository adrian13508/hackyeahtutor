                <p>
                    The SQ3R method is an effective study and reading technique developed to improve understanding and retention of material. 
                    It stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review.
                </p>
                <p><strong>S - Survey:</strong> Begin by quickly surveying the material. Look over headings, subheadings, summaries, and any bolded or highlighted text to get an overview of the content.</p>
                <p><strong>Q - Question:</strong> Turn headings into questions. Asking questions before you start reading helps to focus your attention and sets a purpose for reading.</p>
                <p><strong>R - Read:</strong> Read actively, searching for answers to the questions you've formed. Focus on understanding key concepts and ideas rather than reading word for word.</p>
                <p><strong>R - Recite:</strong> After reading, close the book and try to recite, in your own words, the key points and answers to your questions. This helps solidify the information in your memory.</p>
                <p><strong>R - Review:</strong> Review the material after a few days to reinforce what you've learned. Revisit the questions and see if you can still answer them without looking at the text.</p>
                <p>
                    The SQ3R method not only helps in improving comprehension but also in making studying more efficient by focusing on active reading and engagement with the material.
